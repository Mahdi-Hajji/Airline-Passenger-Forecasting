# Airline-Passenger-Forecasting
## 1. Introduction
Airline passenger forecasting is crucial for efficient airline operation planning, revenue management, and strategic decision-making. Accurate forecasts help in optimizing seat inventory, scheduling flights, and managing resources.

## 2. Problem Statement
The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the number of passengers for an airline based on historical passenger data and other relevant factors.

## 3. Data Preprocessing
This step includes handling missing values, transforming the data, and preparing it for modeling.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize the data to understand trends, seasonality, and patterns.

## 5. Model Selection and Training
Choose and train different models, including baseline models and more advanced ones.

## 8. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing model.
